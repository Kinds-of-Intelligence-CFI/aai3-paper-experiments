# Animal-AI 3 Paper Experiments

This repository contains scripts and source code for the experiments presented in _Animal-AI 3: What's New & Why You Should Care_.

In this repository, you will find:
* The configuration files mentioned in the paper (`configs`).
* Jupyter notebooks to run experiments with Random Action Agents, Heuristic Agents, and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) (`heuristicAgent`, `ppo`, `randomActionAgent`) with an accompanying conda `environment.yml` file for replicating.
* Scripts to run the dreamer agent on a headless server (`dreamer`).
* Saved versions of the PPO agents used in the paper. The dreamer agents are too large to store here - email the authors if you want the saved models for further work (`modelsaves`).
* Full datasets and analysis pipelines for the results presented in the paper (`analysis`).
* Source code with helper functions for some scripts (`aaisrc`).
